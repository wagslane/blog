I've been writing code since 2010, first in Python, then primarily in Go and JS/TS. I've spent most of my career as a backend developer and data engineer. After a couple of years leading teams of Go developers, I'm now working full-time on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) and host the [Backend Banter podcast](https://www.backendbanter.fm).
